<h1>The Basics - What you really need to know</h1>
  <section>
    <p class="pmain">
      So you have a hopefully new laptop, or it might have had a previous owner.<br>
      Unfortunately, we do have to recycle available equipment, especially in the current times.<br>
      That said, the team would have checked the laptop, as carefully as possible, prior to it's issue.<br>
      But if you have any issues with it, contact the <a href="hcll1.html">Service Desk.</a>

  <h2>Password - Rules and how to change them?</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="pmain">
        To make this site as compact as possible, this is on a separate page, as it is a very important topic.<br>
        Please follow this link <a href="pword.html">Company Password Policy</a><br>

  <h2>Where should I save my work files?</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="pmain">
        This is a very <strong>important</strong> issue, and one that we ask all Employees to follow.<br>
        Please <strong>do not</strong> save any work files to the local hard disk of your laptop.<br>
        If you look in File Explorer, <img src="imgs/fex.png" width="30em"> you will see that there is a
        OneDrive - PERNOD RICARD <img src="imgs/onedrive.png" width="40em"> folder.<br>
        You should also see in the 'This PC' section of File Explorer, some mapped Network Drives.<br>
        The standard drives mapped for every CBL user are:<br><br>
        data (\\ukham2kfp01.cbl.pernod-ricard.group) (J:)<br>
        shared (\\ukham2kfp01.cbl.pernod-ricard.group) (S:)<br>
        shared2 (\\ukham2k8ns02.cbl.pernod-ricard.group) (V:)<br>
        shared (\\ukham2k8ns02.cbl.pernod-ricard.group) (W:)<br><br>
        Use OneDrive and these mapped network drives, to save all of your work.<br>
        If your laptop is lost/stolen or is damaged beyond repair, any work not saved in these locations will be lost.<br>
        Both OneDrive and the network locations are backed up, so your work is retrievable.
