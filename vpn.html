<h1>What is a VPN & why is it required?</h2>
  <section>
    <p class="pmain">A VPN or Virtual Private Network is used by Pernod Ricard,<br>
      to allow secure access to Company data, when working outside of any Company Office.<br>
      on a standard network comnnection
    </p>
  </section>
<h2>What is the current VPN software, used by Chivas Brothers?</h2>
  <section>
    <p class="pmain">We currently use a package called BIG-IP Edge Client, otherwise refered to as F5.<br>
      If you look in the Hidden Icons area, bottom right hand side of the screen,<br>
      if the VPN software is active, you should see an <img src="imgs/vpn.png" width="30em"> icon. (Icon shown is represntative)<br>
      The icon can have 1 of 3 states,
      </p
      <ol>
        <li>Greyed out: Disconnected.</li>
        <li>Red: Connected.</li>
        <li>Red with a Flashing padlock: Normally a password issue.</li>
      </ol>
    <p class="pmain">State 3 is explained below. However, if you hover your mouse over the icon, it will show Status text.
    </p>
  </section>
<h2>When should the VPN connect, and what should I look for if it doesn't?</h2>
  <section>
    <p class="pmain">The VPN client should automatically connect, when you laptop is connected to any Non Pernod Ricard network,
      either via wired (cabled), or Wi-Fi (wireless) connection. Laptops should always connect to PR_Employees network,
      when in a Company site office, no VPN required.<br>
      When working from Home, a coffee shop, hotel or any Public area that has a wired or Wi-Fi connection, the VPN client must always be active,
      so you can access Company data.<br>
      If you have any issues accessing shared network drives, outside of the Office, the first place to look is in the 'Hidden Icons' area.<br>
      Hover over the 'F5' icon, to see it's text status. If you have changed you Windows password, but not used your laptop outside of the Office,
      then your will see a Flashing Yellow Padlock on the icon. The 'F5' password does not automatically update, so your old Windows password
      is still saved.<br>
      Double click on the 'F5' icon, and a pop-up window will appear. Enter your new Windows password into the password box, and make
      sure the 'Save Password' box is ticked.
